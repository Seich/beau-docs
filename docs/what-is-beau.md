# What is Beau?

Beau is a general purpose HTTP client. You can describe your requests using YAML. These requests can be composed together allowing you to carefully chain related requests. This allows you to use Beau to rapidly test your APIs. It is extendable using plugins, these plugins can expand Beau in any desired way.  The `Beau.yml` file can be stored in your code repositories, allowing you to easily share and collaborate on it.
